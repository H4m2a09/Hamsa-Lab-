Hi, I am Hamsa. Aspiring IT & DevOps enthusiast | Exploring system monitoring, cloud, and software development | Lifelong learner

On this page, I highlight my projects and include a short overview of each, showing what I built and learned along the way.

SYSTEM MONOTORING:
In this project, I monitored my laptop’s system performance using Task Manager. The goal was to observe CPU, memory, disk, GPU, and network usage to understand how system resources are utilized and to practice basic monitoring and troubleshooting skills.

POSTERS:
* Phishing Awareness Poster
This poster highlights 5 common signs of phishing emails, such as suspicious links, urgent requests, and unusual senders.
It was designed to improve security awareness and demonstrate the importance of spotting social engineering attacks.

* Tech Misconceptions Poster
This poster addresses common IT misconceptions (e.g., “Macs can’t get viruses”) and explains the reality in simple terms.
It was created to show communication skills and the ability to make technical topics easy for everyone to understand.
