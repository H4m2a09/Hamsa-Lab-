Hi, I am Hamsa. Aspiring IT & DevOps enthusiast | Exploring system monitoring, cloud, and software development | Lifelong learner

On this page, I highlight my projects and include a short overview of each, showing what I built and learned along the way.

SYSTEM MONOTORING:
In this project, I monitored my laptopâ€™s system performance using Task Manager. The goal was to observe CPU, memory, disk, GPU, and network usage to understand how system resources are utilized and to practice basic monitoring and troubleshooting skills.
