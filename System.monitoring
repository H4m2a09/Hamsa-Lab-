System Monitoring For My Laptop 
  HARDWARE: HP Laptop
  SOFTWARE: Windows 10 
OBJECTIVE: To monitor system performance using Task Manager and identify resource usage (CPU, Memory, Disk, and Network).

1. Opened Task Manager 
   * Shortcut: ctrl+shift+esc
   * Navigated to the performance tab 
2. Checked Resource Utilisation
   * CPU fluctuating constantly
   * Memory: Between 86-89% (=3.3/3.7GB)
   * Disk: Fluctuates heavily â€” either close to 100% (dips slightly around that range) or 0% (dips slightly in that range)
   * Wifi: * SSID: TP-LINK_E32E
           * Type: 802.11n
           * Signal: ~4bars
           * Send:~0kps
           * Receive:~0kps
           * Connection Type: 802.11n
           * Adapter Name: RTL8821CE 802.11ac
    * GPU: 0% Intel(R) UHD Graphic 
        
Findings: CPU: Overall system load is very low; spikes likely caused by background processes or Task Manager polling. No sustained high CPU usage observed.
          Memory: Memory usage is high relative to total available RAM. Running multiple browser tabs or background apps could lead to pressure on memory, potentially causing swapping or performance lag.
          Disk: Disk activity is inconsistent. Occasional spikes may indicate background Windows processes or temporary file access. No consistent bottleneck observed.
          Wifi: Network is idle during monitoring; stable connection with strong signal. Low utilization suggests no significant network load at this time.
          GPU: Intel(R) UHD Graphics is idle; no GPU-intensive tasks running.

Key Points Found In My System:
    *System is under light load; CPU and GPU idle most of the time.
    *Memory usage is high, which may affect performance if additional applications are launched.
    *Disk activity shows spikes but no persistent bottleneck.
    *Network is stable but inactive.
